Looking at serializable 

Program to Interface, not to an implementation using

Implementing means writing code

An interface must have atleast one method
An interface is a very abstract class and contains only abstract methods no code

  An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract â€” it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be    instantiated, but they can be subclassed. An abstract class may have static fields and static methods.
