Looking at serializable 

Program to Interface, not to an implementation using

Implementing means writing code

An interface must have atleast one method
An interface is a very abstract class and contains only abstract methods no code

  An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract â€” it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be    instantiated, but they can be subclassed. An abstract class may have static fields and static methods.

  It is legall to have a form of multiple inheritance safely 

  Interface 
    -contract
      .responsibilty
      .benefit
      -only abstract methods => no code
      -Ability
      -no data

      interfaces often have i infront to identify it as an interface

      anything that streams down the inheritance tree can be accessed if inheirted in the subclasses

      "the interface segregation principle"
